# spellbot

the spell bot

The spot allows users to cast spells by reacting to messages.

Certain reacts carry a weight for/against the user/message.

So a spell might contribute 5% to the ban of a user. It depends on the casting users role.

Different percentages can trigger threeholds- information, warning, kicking, ban, whatever.
It could be a DM or a reply.

It can be set to per user, it can be set to per message.
